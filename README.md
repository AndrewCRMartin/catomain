catomain
========

(c) William R Taylor
--------------------

The original code is a FORTRAN program that uses the methods of Mike
Levitt (1977) to calculate mainchain atom positions from a PDB file
containing only C-alpha positions.

(c) 1996, UCL, Andrew C.R. Martin
---------------------------------

Modified to remove main program from the FORTRAN and to use a C
wrapper so that it can be used as a filter
